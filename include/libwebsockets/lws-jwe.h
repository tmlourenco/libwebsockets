/**
 * lws_jwe_create_packet() - add b64 sig to b64 hdr + payload
 *
 * \param jwk: the struct lws_jwk containing the signing key
 * \param algtype: the signing algorithm
 * \param hash_type: the hashing algorithm
 * \param payload: unencoded payload JSON
 * \param len: length of unencoded payload JSON
 * \param nonce: Nonse string to include in protected header
 * \param out: buffer to take signed packet
 * \param out_len: size of \p out buffer
 * \param conext: lws_context to get random from
 *
 * This creates a "flattened" JWS packet from the jwk and the plaintext
 * payload, and signs it.  The packet is written into \p out.
 *
 * This does the whole packet assembly and signing, calling through to
 * lws_jws_sign_from_b64() as part of the process.
 *
 * Returns the length written to \p out, or -1.
